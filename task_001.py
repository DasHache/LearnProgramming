# Part I. Learn what is "Stack" about.
# 
# (You can use Google, Youtube or any other way. 
# For example, wikipedia: 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)
# 
# In short: 
# "stack" is a collection of something with 2 principal operations:
#   1. PUSH (adds one more something to the collection)
#   2. POP  (removes the most recently added something)

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Part II. Why do you need it.
#
# It is one of most common data structures. It can be used to solve many problems.
# For example, you have a task: "I give you a word. You need to reverse this word."
#
# Can you write a program which does this? 
# Yes, do it. No? Yes, but lazy? Keep reading...

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Part III. How to use it.
#
# Python doesn't know "stack", it knows "list". Close enough. Let's use it. 
# Run python in bash and try the following:
# https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-stacks
# 
# What you need to remember is that python's LIST has:
#   1. APPEND (same as stack's push) 
#   2. POP (same as stack's pop)

# Now, rememeber what "loop" is? 
# Look here: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements
# 
# What you need to understand is:
