# Task 005.

# Have a look at images in the folder "./images/"
# There you have 2 images:
#   tank_000.png
#   tank_001.png

# Right now your `python game.py` creates something 
# that looks like tank_000.png.

# You task is to make it create something that looks like tank_001.png.
# Namely, your canvas should contain:
#  1. a mountain (big black rectangle)
#  2. a tank on the mountain (smaller red rectagle)
#  3. a barrel attached to the middle of the tank (long narrow rectangle)

# That's it. 3 points.
